# a brief overview of monoimage, kexec and linuxrc
# lemon 20040610

0. 'kexec' is a kernel mod and userspace program allowing the running kernel
   to load another kernel, as if from cold boot.

0. 'monoimage' is a file containing a kernel, initrd and rootfs, laid out in a
   specific way.

1. we use a modified kexec that can handle our monoimage format.

2. the initrd we build into a monoimage contains our custom linuxrc.

3. this linuxrc is run when the new kernel boots, and it inspects the
   original monoimage file to suss the offset for the rootfs.

4. using this offset, linuxrc loopback mounts the rootfs.

5. since we told the kexec'd kernel to mount loop0 as the rootfs all is good,
   and we're now booted into our new kernel with its bundled rootfs,
   /all from a single file/

6. profit / beer / whatever does it for you
